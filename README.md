# Simple Game+
An ai remaster of a ai generated game called Simple Game, which was generated on 10th January 2022 using ChatGPT and Dall-E and curated in Flashpoint Archive by 18th March 2023 by God knows who.

This remaster has been done suing the original assets of the original version and used Trae with Claude 3.7 Sonnet model to generate the remaster.

Everything in the remaster is created by ai, both Claude 3.7 Sonnet for my remaster and ChatGPT with Dall-E for the original Simple Game assets.


# Copyright notice
I do not own the original ai generated game, will credit once the creator behind the original Simple Game is found.
